# Poker3 Keyboard Layout for Mac


## Description
- We use both [hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) and [karabiner-elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) to create custom key bindings.
- This preset allows you to keep your hands on home rows all the time. Hence it increases your productivity.
- This works by using Caplock as the modifier key, then we bind it with other keys to trigger many most used keys such as Arrow, Delete, Backspace keys, etc.

## Operating System Requirements
- MacOS Only.

## Installation and Setup
- Download and install both of these: 
   - [karabiner-elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)
